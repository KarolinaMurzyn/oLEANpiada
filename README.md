## Overview

A website for 'oLEANpiada' - a lean management competition for high school students, conducted by student scientific club **'SKNZ ZarzÄ…dzanie**. This project is part of the **AGH LeanLine 4.0** initiative, funded by the university's **"Grant Rektora"** competition.

## Objective

The primary goal was to create a simple and user-friendly website to facilitate access to information for participants of the "oLEANpiada" competition.

## Key Features

- Event details section (date, time, and venue)
- Document repository and important dates
- Competition overview
- Contact information
- Mocking test for theoretical knowledge

## Technologies Used
The website was built using modern web development technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Responsive design principles were implemented to ensure optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Future Enhancements
The current version of the website fulfills the primary objectives, however the long-term plan is to develop a website for the overarching AGH Lean Line 4.0 project. Within this larger platform, the "oLEANpiada" competition will be integrated as a dedicated subpage. Additionally, the website will be prepared to accommodate future editions of competition.
